# InterviewPreparation

I am an experienced Back-end Engineer who ventured into Data Analytics couple of years back.
I am trying to get back into Software Development from Data Analytics and took time off to prepare for SWE interviews.
This is a repository created for my reference during preparation, and made it public so it helps anyone preparing for the interviews.

I have referred to a lot of material available online (on YouTube, Medium, etc.), the top 6 YouTube handles being:
